    {o Red}Hang on, now.{. 1.5}
    Give me just a sec.{.}.{.}.{.}{np}
    Hi!
    Nice to see you again, and once again, congrats on your new job at the {# Yellow}Museum of Digital Arts{/#}!{np}
    That's {# Yellow}M{.}o{.}D{.}A{.}{/#} for short, by the way.{np}
    As you know, at the {# Yellow}MoDA{/#}, we research historical artefacts and depictions of primarily Photons in past times.{np}
    Your role will involve assisting in this research work, alongside tracking forgeries and art thefts.{np}
    Having to relocate is a bit of a pain, isn't it?{np}
    I'm sure you'll love it here, though!{np}
    Over here in {# Yellow}Chroma City{/#}, we live pretty peacefully with the mysterious creatures known as {# HotPink}Photons{/#}.{np}
    We complement each other pretty well, help each other to accomplish difficult tasks...even having Photons battle each other is particularly popular!{np}
    The bonds between people and Photons are pretty tight!{np}
    All right. I just need some information about you, so I can have your curator license ready.{np}
    Let's start with your picture, mind sending me one?{/o}
